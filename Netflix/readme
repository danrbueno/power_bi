This project consists in a dashboard based in a Netflix public dataset, available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies.
The main idea of the dashboard is to summarize data from the titles and genres based in a filter that lists all the countries.
This dataset was downloaded with all the titles genres and production countries in a unique title row. 
It was a problem, because we didn't have a list of countries and the genres to make the dashboard work.
So, there are scripts made in Python that read the dataset with the genres and countries and put into another datasets.
OBS: to make the scripts works, first run the create_countries_dataset.ipynb.
The comments and instructions are in the scripts.

Thanks!
